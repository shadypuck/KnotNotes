\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Knot}: \dq{A knotted loop of string, except that we think of the string as having no thickness, its cross-section being a single point}{2}
    \item Do not distinguish between a `nice, even' knot and one that has been deformed through space.
    \item \textbf{Unknot}: \dq{The simplest knot of all\dots the unknoted circle}{2} \emph{Also known as} \textbf{trivial knot}. See Figure \ref{fig:circletrefoila}.
    \item \textbf{Trefoil knot}: \dq{The next simplest knot}{2} See Figure \ref{fig:circletrefoilb}.

    \item \textbf{Projection}: A picture of a knot, such as those in Figure \ref{fig:circletrefoil}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The same knots can have multiple projections (as they are deformed in space).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Crossings}: The places in a projection where a knot crosses itself.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The trefoil knot in Figure \ref{fig:circletrefoilb} is a \underline{three-crossing knot} because it crosses itself 3 times.
        \item Any one-crossing knot is trivial.
        \item \emph{Exercise 1.2}: Any two-crossing knot must be trivial because the simplest nontrivial knot is the trefoil knot, which has three crossings.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Atoms were originally thought to be tangles (knots) in the ether of the universe, but when chemists moved on, mathematicians took up knot theory. In the 1980s, biochemists began to see applications of knot theory in their research (see Section \ref{sse:biochemphys}).
    \item \textbf{Topology}: \dq{The study of the properties of geometric objects that are preserved under deformations}{6}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Knot theory is a subfield of topology (see Section \ref{sse:topology}).

    \item Any knot can have a projection with as many crossings as desired.
    \item \textbf{Alternating knot}: \dq{A knot with a projection that has crossings that alternate between over and under as one travels around the knot in a fixed direction}{7}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The trefoil is such a knot.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 1.7*}: By changing some of the crossings from over to under or vice versa, any projection of a knot can be made into a projection of the unknot$^[$\footnote{How can I \emph{show} something? How can I do these proofs? What kind of logic solves one of these? See Section \ref{sss:UnknottingNumber} for a direct proof of/solution to Exercise 1.7.}$^]$. See Figure \ref{fig:knottotrivial}.

\subsection{Composition of Knots}\label{sss:Composition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Composition} (of two knots): \dq{A new knot obtained by removing a small arc from two knot projections and then connecting the four endpoints by two new arcs}{7}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If two knots are designated $J$ and $K$, then their composition is denoted $J\#K$.
        \item Do not overlap the projections and choose two arcs that are on the outside to avoid new crossings.
        \item Make sure that the new arcs do not cross any of the the original knot projections or each other.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Composite knot}: A knot that \dq{can be expressed as the composition of two knots, neither of which is the trivial knot}{8}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This definition is analogous to composite integers, where an integer is \underline{composite} if it is the product of positive integers, neither of which is $1$.
        \item Similarly, if we compose any knot with the unknot, we get the same knot back.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Factor knots}: \dq{The knots that make up the composite knot}{8}
    \item \textbf{Prime knot}: \dq{A knot [that] is not the composition of any two nontrivial knots}{9}
    \item The unknot, trefoil knot, and figure-eight knots are all prime (see Section \ref{sss:GenusSeifert}).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The unknot is not composite for the same reason that 1 is not the product of two integers greater than 1.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \emph{Exercise 1.8}: Using the appendix table, identify the factor knots that make up the composite knot in Figure \ref{fig:compos1}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The knot in Figure \ref{fig:compos1} is the composition of two projections of $5_2$.

    \item There is more than one way to take the composition of two knots (by removing different arcs).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is not analogous to multiplication --- a break in the pattern.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Orientation}: A direction to travel around the knot. Denoted by placing \dq{coherently directed arrows along the projection of the knot in the direction of our choice}{10} A knot with such arrows is \textbf{oriented}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All compositions $J\#K$ where the orientations of $J$ and $K$ \underline{do} match up will yield the same composite knot.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $J$ can be `slid around' $J\#K$ until it reaches the second position where the composition was taken.
        \end{itemize}
        \item All compositions $J\#K$ where the orientations of $J$ and $K$ \underline{do not} match up will yield the same composite knot.
        \item These two compositions can be distinct.

    \item \textbf{Invertible}: A knot that can be deformed back to itself so that an orientation on it is sent to the opposite orientation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \dq{In the case that one of the two knots is invertible, say $J$, we can always deform the composite knot so that the orientation on $K$ is reversed, and hence so that the orientations of $J$ and $K$ always match. Therefore, there is only one composite knot that we can construct from the two knots}{11}
    \end{itemize}
    \item To determine the possible compositions of knots, it is necessary to know which knots are invertible, but no general technique has yet been discovered.

\subsection{Reidemeister Moves}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ambient isotropy}: \dq{The movement of the string through three-dimensional space without letting it pass through itself}{12}
    \item \textbf{Planar isotropy}: A deformation of \dq{the projection plane as if it were made of ruber with the projection drawn upon it}{12}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stretching, squeezing, rotating, bending single arcs, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reidemeister move}: \dq{One of three ways to change a projection of the knot that \emph{will} change the relation between the crossings}{13}
    \item \textbf{First Reidemeister move}: \dq{Put in or take out a twist in the knot}{13} See Figure \ref{fig:reidema}. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{type I Reidemeister move}.
    \item \textbf{Second Reidemeister move}: \dq{Either add two crossings or remove two crossings}{13} See Figure \ref{fig:reidemb}. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{type II Reidemeister move}.
    \item \textbf{Third Reidemeister move}: \dq{Slide a strand of the knot from one side of a crossing to the other side of the crossing}{13} See Figure \ref{fig:reidemc}. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{type III Reidemeister move}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that the crossings in Figure \ref{fig:reidem} can be reversed and the move will still be classified under the same category.

    \item Although a linking number is computed using a single projection of a link, the linking number will be the same for any projection of the link.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This can be proven by demonstrating that the Redemeister moves do not change the linking number. \dq{Since we can get from any one projection of a link to any other via a sequence of Reidemeister moves, none of which will change the linking number, it must be that two different projections of the same link yield the same linking number}{20}
        \item Let's take this case by case.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A Type I Reidemeister move generates a self-intersection. Because self-crossings do not count toward the linking number by definition, the first Reidemeister move does not affect the linking number.
            \item A Type II Reidemeister move generates two crossings. There are now two cases: Either the new crossings are self-intersections or they are not. If the new crossings are self-intersections, then there is no change to the linking number. If the new crossings are not self-intersections, they will always have opposite linking numbers, and, thus, the two new crossings cancel each other out. Therefore, the second Reidemeister move does not affect the linking number.
            \item A Type III Reidemeister move removes two crossings and generates two crossings. There are now two cases: Either the new crossings are self-intersections or they are not. If the new crossings are self-intersections, then there is no change to the linking number. If the new crossings are not self-intersections, both pairs of crossings will always have opposite linking numbers and, thus, both pairs of crossings cancel each other out. Therefore, the third Reidemeister move does not affect the linking number.
        \end{itemize}
        \item This logic can be visually confirmed by assigning orientations and counting crossings in Figure \ref{fig:reidem}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Invariant}: A quality of a knot or link that, once orientations are chosen, is unchanged by ambient isotropy.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Both the linking number and the number of components are \underline{link invariants}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 1.16}: Explain why the linking number of a splittable two-component link will always be $0$, no matter what projection is used to compute it.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textsc{Solution 1}: By definition, the linking number numerically measures how linked up two components are. Since splittable links are not joined (or "linked up") in any way, the linking number must be $0$.
        \item \textsc{Solution 2}: If a two-component link is splittable, then there exists a projection of it with no crossings that are not self-intersections (a projection of the split link, as in Figure \ref{fig:unlinkHopfb}). If all crossings are self-intersections, then the linking number computed for this projection must be $0$. Now that it is known that said link has a linking number of $0$, any combination of Reidemeister moves can be used to manipulate the link into any other projection. But because Reidemeister moves do not affect the linking number, the linking number will remain $0$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The absolute value of the linking number, as a link invariant, can be used to distinguish certain distinct links, regardless of orientation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \dq{Any two links with two components that have distinct absolute values of their linking numbers have to be different links}{21}
        \item For example, the difference in linking number between the unlink (0; Figure \ref{fig:unlinkHopfa}) and the Hopf link (1; Figure \ref{fig:unlinkHopfb}) distinguishes them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item However, the linking number cannot distinguish between all links.

        \item For instance, both the Whitehead link (Figure \ref{fig:WhiteheadBorromeana}) and the unlink (Figure \ref{fig:unlinkHopfa}) have linking number 0.
        \item One such distinction is discussed in Section \ref{sss:tricolor}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Brunnian link}: A nontrivial link where the removal of any one component leaves behind a set of trivial unlinked circles.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Borromean rings (Figure \ref{fig:WhiteheadBorromeanb}) are Brunnian$^[$\footnote{How can I draw a Brunnian link with four components? Or more?}$^]$.

\subsection{Tricolorability}\label{sss:tricolor}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do we \emph{prove} that every knot is not just a projection of the unknot?
    \item \textbf{Strand}: \dq{A piece of the link that goes from one undercrossing to another with only overcrossings in between}{23}
    \item \textbf{Tricolorable}: A projection of a knot or link in which each strand \dq{can be colored one of three different colors, so that at each crossing, either three different colors come together or all the same color comes together}{23}

    \item Reidemeister moves do not affect tricolorability.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A Type I Reidemeister move generates a self-intersection. At such a crossing (made out of one original strand), every color will be the same; only one color meets at the crossing.
        \item A Type II Reidemeister move generates two crossings. If the strands are the same color, then everything stays the same color. If the strands are different colors, than newly created loop takes on the third color.
        \item Type III has many cases (\emph{Exercise 1.23}).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Since the unknot is not tricolorable and the trefoil knot is, we have just proven that there is at least one other knot besides the unknot.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tricolorability is a knot invariant.
    \end{itemize}
    \item For links, tricolorability is a bit different --- the unlink, for example, is tricolorable.

\subsection{Knots and Sticks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can also consider knots made out of straight sticks glued to each other at each end.
    \item The first nontrivial knot made out of sticks is the trefoil, with six sticks.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We know that the stick trefoil in Figure \ref{fig:sticktrefoil} could be made in the real world because, if two vertices lie in the $xy$-plane, then two lie above and two lie below.
        \item This P(lanar), L(ow), H(igh) notation is commonly used.

\section{Tabulating Knots}\label{sse:tabulating}
\subsection{History of Knot Tabulation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Although many mathematicians (including Gauss) had dabbled with knots, Lord Kelvin's theory that atoms were knotted vortices in the ether (referenced in Section \ref{sss:Introduction}) kicked off research in earnest.
    \item Reverend Thomas P. Kirkman began tabulating knots but wrote poorly.
    \item However, Kirkman's ideas were applied by Scottish physicist Peter Guthrie Tait to list all alternating knots up to 10 crossings.
    \item C. N. Little of the University of Nebraska was the first to tackle the nonalternating knots.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He tabulated up to 10 crossings (43 knots total).
        \item However, in 1974, it was discovered that two knots were, in fact, the same and there were really 42 knots.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Kenneth A. Perko, a part time mathematician and New York lawyer, discovered that the projections were not distinct. As such, the projections are known as the Perko pair (Figure \ref{fig:perkopair}).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 2.1}: Show that the Perko pair (projected in Figure \ref{fig:perkopair}) are the same knot.

    \end{figure}
    \item Little later published a census of 11-crossing alternating knots with 11 omissions and 1 duplication.
    \item Mary G. Haseman listed all amphicheiral knots of 12 crossings.
    \item Early on, there were few attempts to \emph{prove} that the tabulated knots were actually distinct.
    \item In 1927, Alexander and Briggs proved that the knots up to 9 crossings were distinct.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They developed the first knot polynomial, the Alexander polynomial.
        \item This would remain the only knot polynomial until 1984.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Once Kurt Reidemeister finished rigorously classifying the knots up to 9 crossings in 1932, tabulation was inactive for a while.
    \item In 1969, John H. Conway developed a new notation and used it to determine all of the prime knots up to 11 crossings and all prime nonsplittable links up to 10 crossings.
    \item In 1978, Alain Caudron of the University of Paris corrected Conway's tabulation a bit.
    \item Meanwhile, a new notation was developed by Hugh Dowker (see Section \ref{sss:Dowker}) that was implemented as a computer algorithm by Morwen Thistlethwaite.
    \item In the 1980s-1990s (with computer help), Jim Hoste, Thistlethwaite, and Jeff Weeks (an expert in hyperbolic knots; see Section \ref{sss:Hyperbolic}) tabulated up to 16-crossing knots.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that the number of knots of successive numbers of crossings \emph{appears} to grows exponentially (this is unproven).
        \item Also note that Hoste et al's listed knots includes those that are not amphicheiral only once, so those knots actually represent 2 distinct knots.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Determining amphicheirality is discussed in Section \ref{sse:polynomials}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item On drawing a 14-crossing knot.
    \item Claus Ernst and Dewitt Sumners proved a lower exponential bound on the number of distinct prime knots (see Section \ref{sss:Bridge}).
    \item Dominic Welsh proved an upper exponential bound on the number of distinct prime knots.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The Dowker Notation for Knots}\label{sss:Dowker}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For alternating knots\dots
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Begin by choosing an orientation.
        \item Label an arbitrary crossing 1.
        \item Leaving that crossing on the understrand, label the next crossing 2.
        \item Continue through the crossing on the same strand and label the next crossing 3.
        \item Continue in this fashion until you have gone all the way around the knot once.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Note that this gives each crossing two numbers.

    \end{figure}
    \item \emph{Exercise 2.2}: Why does every crossing get one even numbered label and one odd numbered label?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Because the knot is alternating --- every understrand will add an odd label and every overstrand will add an even number (because you set off on the understrand after labeling your starter crossing 1).

        \label{tab:Dowkertrefoil}
    \end{table}
    \item From the counting in Figure \ref{fig:Dowkertrefoil}, we obtain a pairing between the numbers (Table \ref{tab:Dowkertrefoil}).
    \item Note that the numbers in the top row of Table \ref{tab:Dowkertrefoil} are constantly increasing odd numbers.
    \item Since the top row numbers are in a predictable pattern, we can shorthand the notation for the trefoil knot in Figure \ref{fig:Dowkertrefoil} to 4 6 2.
    \item \dq{Thus, from a projection of a knot, we obtain a sequence of even integers, where the number of even integers is exactly the number of crossings in the knot}{36}
    \item \emph{Exercise 2.3}: Find a sequence of even integers that represents the projection of the knots $6_2$ and $6_3$ (Figure \ref{fig:ex2-3}). How about a second sequence of even integers that also represents the same projection of $6_3$?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For Figure \ref{fig:ex2-3a}, write 6 8 10 12 2 4.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 4 6 2 10 12 8 gives two distinct knots.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \dq{Note that the two knots are composite knots, and that this is refleted in the fact that the sequence 4 6 2 10 12 8 is actually a shuffling of the three numbers 2, 4, 6 and then a shuffling of the three numbers 8, 10, and 12}{38}
        \end{itemize}
        \item When the Dowker notation can be broken into two subpermutations (as above) the knot is composite (unless one subpermutation is trivial).
        \item Any sequence that cannot be split in this way represents either a particular knot or its mirror image.
        \item If the knot is amphicheiral, then the sequence only represent one knot.
    \end{itemize}
    \item A knot and its mirror image are equivalent when projected onto a sphere as opposed to a plane.
    \item \emph{Exercise 2.6}: Draw two projections given by 10 12 2 14 6 4 8, which are inequivalent as projections in the plane but which are equivalent as projections on the sphere.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are $7!=5040$ sequences.
    \end{itemize}
    \item There is a slightly modified Dowker notation for nonalternating knots.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \dq{If the even integer is assigned to the crossing while we are on the overstrand at that crossing, we leave the even integer positive. But if the even integer is assigned to the crossing while we are on the understrand of that crossing, we make the corresponding even numbers negative}{39}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 2.9}: How can you recognize from the sequence of numbers that a projection has a trivial crossing in it like in Figure \ref{fig:ex2-9a}? How about recognizing a Type II Reidemeister move that will reduce the number of crossings by two like in Figure \ref{fig:ex2-9b}?

    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A Type I Reidemeister move can be recognized from the Dowker notation sequence by the pairing of two numbers that have an absolute difference of 1. In Figure \ref{fig:ex2-9a}, a sample Dowker notation is 6 2 8 10 4. Since 2 pairs with 3, and $|2-3|=1$, we know that there is a Type I Reidemeister move. Logically, this makes sense because when moving along the orientation, a trivial crossing will be crossed twice in a row.
        \item A Type II Reidemeister move can be recognized from the Dowker notation sequence by a specific characteristic of two pairs: If $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is such a pair, where the order is listed such that $|x_2|>|x_1|$ and $|y_1|>|y_2|$, then both of the following must be true.
        \begin{align}
            \big||x_1|-|x_2|\big|=1=\big||y_1|-|y_2|\big| && |x_1-y_2|\neq\big||x_1|-|y_2|\big|\label{eqn:typeIIdowker}
        \end{align}
        In Figure \ref{fig:ex2-9b}, a sample Dowker notation is 8 6 10 $-2$ 12 4. Since ($-2$,7) and (3,6) are pairs that satisfy the above, we know that there is a Type II Reidemeister move. Logically, this makes sense because, when moving along the orientation, such crossings' numbers will be sequential both times crossed (confirmed by the left statement in Equation \ref{eqn:typeIIdowker}). Additionally, the even numbers must have opposite signs or the strand would be linked, as opposed to entirely above or below (confirmed by the right statement in Equation \ref{eqn:typeIIdowker}).
    \end{itemize}
    \item The most consequential fact of Dowker notation is that it allows us to \dq{feed projections of knots into the computer simply as a sequence of numbers}{40}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Conway's Notation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Particularly suited to calculations involving \textbf{tangles}.
    \item \textbf{Tangle}: \dq{A region [in a knot or link] in the projection plane surrounded by a circle such that the knot or link crosses the circle exactly four times}{41}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These four crossings will be thought of as occurring in the four ordinal compass directions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Tangles can be thought of as building blocks in knot or link projections.
    \item \textbf{Equivalent}: Two tangle projections that can be transformed into each other via a series of Reidemeister moves \dq{while the four endpoints of the strings in the tangle remain fixed and while the strings of the tangle never journey outside the circle defining the tangle}{41}
    \item Notice that, if a knot is formed by gluing together the tangle's ends in pairs, the knot is equivalent to other projections of itself as long as the tangles are equivalent (by a series of Reidemeister moves).
    \item Tangles, such as the one in Figure \ref{fig:tanglesc} are denoted by the number of left-hand twists (crossings).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If we had twisted the tangle the other way, we would have called it $-3$.
        \item More simply, \dq{for a positive-integer twist, the overstrand always has a positive slope, if we think of it as a small segment of a line [perhaps a cubic, in the case of Figure \ref{fig:tanglesc}]}{42}

        \item Therefore, tangles 2 and 4 (Figures \ref{fig:ex2-13b} and \ref{fig:ex2-13d}, respectively) are equivalent by equations \ref{eqn:ex2-13b} and \ref{eqn:ex2-13d}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item If we close off the ends of a rational tangle, i.e. NE to NW and SE to SW, we form a rational link.
    \item If the link is a knot, we can denote it by its tangle. For example, the figure-eight knot is a rational knot with \textbf{Conway notation} 22 (because of the two twists twice in its center and the gluing of its ends).
    \item \textbf{Conway's notation}: A method of denoting knots by their tangles (all aforementioned theory in this section).
    \item Multiplying tangles:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reflect the left tangle across its NW to SE diagonal and then glue its new NE and SE ends to the NW and SW ends, respectively, of the adjacent (to the right) tangle.
        \item Multiplying a rational tangle by an integer tangle will always generate a rational tangle, e.g. 32 comes from multiplying 3 by 2.
        \item To reflect a tangle over its NW-SE line, multiply it by the tangle, 0.

    \item \emph{Exercise 2.21}: Is there an additive identity for tangles?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The 0 tangle (Figure \ref{fig:tanglesb}) is an additive identity for tangles. Adding the 0 tangle does the same thing as extruding (performing a planar isotropy on) the NE and SE strands. Such an addition does not change the relative position of any strand's ordinal end(s).
        \item Continuing the analogy to the real numbers, it makes sense that the 0 tangle would be analogous to 0, the real number.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multiplicative identity}: A quantity that can be multiplied by a second quantity without changing that second quantity.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 is a multiplicative identity for the real numbers.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 2.22}: Is there a multiplicative identity for tangles? Is it the same if you multiply a tangle by it on the right side or the left side?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The 0 tangle (Figure \ref{fig:tanglesb}) is a multiplicative identity for tangles. Multiplying the 0 tangle does the same thing as extruding (performing a planar isotropy on) the SE and SW strands. Such a multiplication does not change the relative position of any strand's ordinal end(s).
        \item To part 2, yes.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The analogy to real numbers does not hold in some areas.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiplication on tangles is not commutative --- $ab\neq ba$ for tangles.
        \item Multiplication on tangles is not associative --- $(ab)c\neq a(bc)$ for tangles.
        \item There are no inverse tangles --- there is no tangle that when added to $T$ gives back the trivial tangle, 0.
    \end{itemize}
    \item There are tangles that are not algebraic.
    \item New knots can be obtained via \textbf{mutation}.
    \item \textbf{Mutation}: Severing the connections between a tangle and any adjacent tangles, transforming it (flipping horizontally, vertically, or both), and gluing the strands to their new adjacent counterparts.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Knots formed in this manner are called \textbf{mutants} of one another.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 2.25}: Show that if we have three tangles as in Figure \ref{fig:ex2-25a}, we can mutate several times in order to permute the tangles. Note that we can then permute $n$ tangles in a row.

\subsection{Knots and Planar Graphs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This section's notation bridges knot theory and graph theory.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is capable of contributing to both branches of mathematics.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graph}: A set of points called vertices that are connected by edges.
    \item \textbf{Planar graph}: A graph that lies in a plane.
    \item Creating a planar graph from a projection of a knot or link:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \dq{Shade every other region of the link projection so that the infinite outermost region is not shaded}{51}
        \item \dq{Put a vertex at the center of each shaded region and then connect with an edge any two vertices that are in regions that share a crossing}{52}
        \item Assign an orientation.
        \item \dq{Label each edge in the planar graph with a $+$ or a $-$, depending on whether the edge passes through a $+$ crossing or a $-$ crossing}{52} See Figure \ref{fig:crossingsign}. Recall computing link numbers in Section \ref{sss:Links} (see Figure \ref{fig:linkingnumber}, specifically).
        \item The result is a \textbf{signed planar graph}. See Figure \ref{fig:graphtrefoil} for an original example.

        \item Type II Reidemeister move: Add two edges connecting two, specific vertices and intersecting no other edges. The signs on the new edges must be opposite, but it either can be positive (or negative; this option is analogous to the over-under crossing option).

\section{Invariants of Knots}
\subsection{Unknotting Number}\label{sss:UnknottingNumber}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unknotting number}: A value $n\in\mathbb{N}$ specific to a knot $K$ that gives the fewest number of crossing changes needed in any projection to turn it into the unknot. \emph{Also known as} $\mathbf{u(K)}$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It may, however, be a nasty projection of the unknot (see Figure \ref{fig:ex1-11-2} and the related Exercise).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 3.1}: Find the unknotting number of the figure-eight knot (Figure \ref{fig:figure8knot}).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $u(K)=1$, where $K$ is the figure-eight knot.
        \item $K$ is distinct from the unknot, so $u(K)\neq 0$. The next possibility ($u(K)=1$) succeeds with the projection in Figure \ref{fig:figure8knot} (in fact, flipping \emph{any} crossing in the referenced projection trivializes $K$).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Note that performing all of the crossing changes on one projection is equivalent to performing one such change, then an ambient isotropy, then another\dots
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A proof of this is listed on page 58.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \dq{The fact that every knot has a finite unknotting number follows from the fact that every projection of a knot can be changed into a projection of the unknot by changing some subset of the crossings in the projection}{58}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item See Exercise 1.7.
    \end{itemize}
    \item A proof of the above:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pick a starting point (not a crossing) on an arbitrary knot and an orientation in whose direction to traverse the knot.
        \item When you arrive at the first crossing, change it so that the strand that you are on is the over strand, if necessary.
        \item Continue changing every new crossing to which you come to make the current strand into the overstrand.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Do not change crossings that you have already passed through once.
        \end{itemize}
        \item At this point, you now have a projection of a knot that was obtained from the original knot by changing crossings and that is the trivial knot. A proof of this triviality follows.
        \medskip
        \item Consider the knot in three-space, with the $z$-axis coming out of the page. Assign to the starting point the $z$-coordinate, $z=1$.
        \item Decrease the $z$-coordinate of each consecutive point as you traverse the knot, culminating in the original point being labeled, $z=0$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Connect the starting and ending points with a vertical bar to preserve the knot as a knot.
        \end{itemize}
        \item What you have now obtained is a knot in three-space that, when projected from the top is the knot that we constructed before the line break, but has no crossings when projected from the side (and is therefore the trivial knot).
        \item Q.E.D.
    \end{itemize}
    \item It is very hard, in general, to find the unknotting number of a knot. How do you know that there isn't a better projection?
    \item \dq{A knot with unknotting number 1 is prime}{61}
    \item Therefore, a composite knot cannot be unknotted with a one crossing change.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Another way to think about this idea is that changing a crossing to unknot one factor knot would yield the composition of the other factor knot with the unknot, which, according to Section \ref{sss:Composition}, is simply the other factor knot (obviously still fully knotted).
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{equation}
        u(K_1\#K_2)\leq u(K_1)+u(K_2)

    \item The unknotting number can be realized by a projection that is not \textbf{minimal}.
    \item \textbf{Minimal projection}: The projection of a knot with the lowest possible number of crossings.
    \item \textbf{\emph{k}-move}: A local change in the projection that replaces two untwisted strings with two strings that twist around each other with $k$ crossings in a right-handed manner. See Figure \ref{fig:k-moves}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $k$ is positive, then the overstrand has a positive slope.

    \item \emph{Exercise 3.10}: Show that if a knot has bridge number 1, it must be the unknot.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a knot has bridge number 1, $\exists$ a projection of the knot such that there is only one arc above the projection plane and 1 arc below the projection plane.
        \item This projection, viewed from above, will look like any isotropy of the knot. However, viewed from the side, there will be 0 crossings --- therefore, it is the unknot.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 3.11}: Show that the knot $5_2$ has bridge number 2$^[$\footnote{Idea for a paper: On reducing bridge number. Discuss manipulating a projection to its Dowker reconstruction to create the "killzone" and then using "bridging moves" to make the projection nonalternating. 2 types so far: I $\rightarrow$ III, and 2xII $\rightarrow$ III (in both cases it is the Type III move which climactically changes $b(K)$. It can be necessary to increase $b(K)$ before decreasing it.)}$^]$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Since $5_2$ is distinct from the unknot, $b(K)\neq 1$.
        \item Therefore, the next possibility to check is 2. If $\exists$ a projection of $5_2$ with bridge number 2, $b(K)=2$.

        \item Before tackling this problem, though, let's look at some simpler examples.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item From these, we notice that there are "bridging moves" (distinct combinations of the Reidemeister moves) that can shift the bridge number by $\pm 1$.
            \item Furthermore, long overstrands call to mind a Dowker reconstruction (Figure \ref{fig:reconstruction}).
        \end{itemize}
        \item Find the Dowker notation of $5_2$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Dowker notation of the projection listed in the appendix is 6 10 8 2 4.

        \item Note that the following hold for all projections in Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dashes, when present, represent the boundaries of the "killzone." They also provide consistent reference points for Figures \ref{fig:ex3-11-2a} through \ref{fig:ex3-11-2e}.
            \item Dots, when present, represent bounds on the overpasses (and, consequently, the underpasses).
            \item Thicker lines represent overpasses. Conversely, thinner lines represent underpasses.
            \item Like-colored strands between sequential projections represent the same strand after Reidemeister moves or planar isotropies (colored for clarity, not for any specific purpose such as tricolorability).
        \end{itemize}
        \item From the previously determined Dowker notation, reconstruct a knot projection. This projection (Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2a}) contains the "killzone," a concentrated region where every crossing is displayed in an orderly fashion$^[$\footnote{Note that from here-down, I do not guarantee that this is the fastest or simplest way to generate a projection that displays $b(K)=2$, nor can I assure the reader that my solution is the "simplest" projection (perhaps the one with the fewest crossings). However, I do guarantee that it is correct. I know that it is so because all projections are separated only by Reidemeister moves and planar isotropies, and Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2f} visibly has bridge number 2.}$^]$.
        \item Employ two Type I Reidemeister moves followed respectively by Type III Reidemeister moves to eliminate two overpasses. These moves occur on the green and blue strands, independently. They yield a projection with bridge number 3 (Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2b}). This projection has several noteworthy properties.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item First, of the three overpasses, two contain 2 crossings while one contains 3 crossings.
            \item Second, of the three underpasses, two contain 2 crossings while one contains 3 crossings.
            \item Third, every overpass crosses at least one of its adjacent underpass.
            \item Because each overpass and underpass has more than one crossing, the bridge number of the projection must increase before it can decrease (one of the overpasses must be split into two [or three]; single overpasses can subsequently be eliminated via "bridging moves").
            \item Because each overpass crosses at least one of its adjacent underpasses, no "bridging moves" can eliminate a bridge from this projection directly$^[$\footnote{I am holding this to be true because I cannot demonstrate otherwise, but I do not know that it is true. I'd actually conjecture that it's false --- it would seem to make sense that some overpass could be eliminated directly from Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2b}.}$^]$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Employ two Type II Reidemeister moves followed by one Type III Reidemeister move to split one of the 2-crossing overpasses into two 1-crossing overpasses. These moves occur on the red-purple strand, which is "slid along" beneath the central overpass. This change will increase the bridge number to 4 and yield Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2c}$^[$\footnote{Multiple such moves may suffice here to split a 2-crossing bridge. I chose and followed through this one randomly.}$^]$.
        \item Employ a Type I Reidemeister move followed by a Type III Reidemeister move to eliminate one of the new 1-crossing overpasses. These moves occur on the purple strand. This change will decrease the bridge number back to 3. Additionally, perform the reverse of the actions on the green strand between Figures \ref{fig:ex3-11-2a} and \ref{fig:ex3-11-2b} to "straighten it out." This shift will switch the 1-crossing overpass to an adjacent strand. These changes will yield Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2d}. This projection has several noteworthy properties.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The 1-crossing overpass has underpasses of greater than 1 crossing on both sides.
            \item The 1-crossing overpass passes through a loop, creating a setup similar to the two overpasses eliminated between Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2a} and \ref{fig:ex3-11-2b}. However, because of the above, a Type I Reidemeister move followed by a Type III Reidemeister move will not eliminate this overpass --- it would only shift the position of the overpass.
            \item The 1-crossing overpass crosses neither of its adjacent underpasses.
            \item The above is key --- because of it, a succession of 2xType II Reidemeister moves followed by 1xType III Reidemeister moves can combine the 1-crossing overpass with the partially purple overpass.
            \item This set of moves will occur thrice --- once for each crossing of the adjacent underpass.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Three times sequentially, employ two Type II Reidemeister moves followed by one Type III Reidemeister move to (for the first two sets) shift the position of the 1-crossing overpass and then (for the last set) eliminate the 1-crossing overpass. These moves occur on the orange, purple, and green strands, sequentially. They yield a projection with bridge number 2 (Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2e}).
        \item Q.E.D.
        \item Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2e} is rather visually unpleasant, however. Figure \ref{fig:ex3-11-2f} is the result of one Type I Reidemeister move (on the upper part of the orange strand) and planar isotropies intended purely to "clean up" the projection. It remains indistinct from $5_2$ and displays $b(K)=2$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Two-bridge knots}: Knots that have $b(K)=2$.
    \item If a two-bridge knot is sliced through the projection plane, there will be two \textbf{unknotted untangled} arcs both above and below said plane.
    \item \textbf{Unknotted untangled}: Distinct arcs that have no crossings with each other.
    \item From 2 such unknotted untangled arcs on each side of the projection plane, it is possible to construct all two-bridge knots.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \dq{The tricky part is that although the strings to each side of the plane
        are individually unknotted, they can twist around each other and themselves}{65}
    \end{itemize}
    \item All two-bridge knots are rational knots and vice versa.
    \item Since the two-bridge knots are a very well understood class of knots, properties that are suspected to hold true for all knots are often first proved to hold true for two-bridge knots.
    \item All two-bridge knots are prime.
    \item The first tabulated three-bridge knot is $8_{10}$.
    \item \emph{Exercise 3.13}: Find a picture of $8_{10}$ that shows that it is at most a three-bridge knot.

    \item \emph{Exercise 3.14}: Explain how Shubert's result implies that rational knots are all prime.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To be distinct from the unknot, a knot must have $b(K)\geq 2$, as proven in \emph{Exercise 3.10}.
        \item By Shubert's theorem, above, and the above fact, any composition of two nontrivial knots must have $b(K)\geq 3$ (at least $2+2-1=3$).
        \item Since any knot with $b(K)\geq 3$ is not rational and all composite knots have $b(K)\geq 3$, all rational knots (those with $b(K)=2$) must be noncomposite, or prime.

\subsection{Crossing Number}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Crossing number}: \dq{The least number of crossings that occur in any projection of the knot}{67} \emph{Also known as} $\mathbf{c(K)}$.
    \item To find the crossing number of a knot, first find a projection of the knot. Count the crossings, $n$. At this point, it is clear that $c(K)\leq n$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If all knots with fewer crossing than $n$ are known and $K$ is distinct from all of those knots, then $c(K)=n$.
        \item Otherwise, reduce the knot to its minimal projection.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Proving that a knot is distinct from every knot of fewer crossings is very difficult and requires knot polynomials (see Section \ref{sse:polynomials}).
    \item Determining $c(K)$ is generally very difficult (knots are currently only tabulated up to 13 crossings).
    \item \textbf{Reduced}: A projection of a knot with no easily removed crossings.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All "easily removed" crossings in alternating knots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:easilyremoved}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item However, in 1986, Lou Kauffman, Kunio Murasugi, and Morwen Thistlethwaite all independently proved that \dq{an alternating knot in a reduced alternating projection of $n$ crossings has crossing number $n$}{68}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They utilized the Jones polynomial (see Section \ref{sse:polynomials}).
        \item Because we can visually tell whether or not a projection is reduced (and reduce it if it's not), we can determine $c(K)$ for any alternating knot.
    \end{itemize}
    \item It is still unknown whether or not $c(K_1\#K_2)=c(K_1)+c(K_2)$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item However, Kaufman, Murasugi, and Thistlethwaite's result proves that the above holds when $K_1\#K_2$ is alternating.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Exercise 3.15}: Show that if $K_1$ and $K_2$ are alternating, then so is $K_1\#K_2$. Hence, $c(K_1\#K_2)=c(K_1)+c(K_2)$ holds when $K_1$ and $K_2$ are alternating even if $K_1\#K_2$ does not appear alternating.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item When composing alternating knots, there are two cases, as exemplified by Figure \ref{fig:alternatingcomposa} and \ref{fig:alternatingcomposc}, respectively.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Case 1: the composite knot will be in an alternating projection.
            \item Case 2: the composite knot will not be in an alternating projection.
        \end{itemize}
        \item For Case 1, the theorem evidently holds. See Figure \ref{fig:alternatingcomposb}
        \item For Case 2, first consider the definition of an alternating knot (see Section \ref{sss:Introduction}), which states that an alternating knot need only have \underline{a} projection that is alternating, i.e., \underline{every} projection need not be alternating.
        \item Therefore, if we can prove that every nonalternating projection obtained through a composition has an alternating equivalent, the theorem will be true. To begin, consider several subcases to determine a pattern in the nonalternation.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Because $K_1$ and $K_2$ are both alternating, any arc being removed (to compose the two) will necessarily be on an understrand becoming an overstrand or vice versa.
            \item Therefore, if we leave $K_1$ to enter $K_2$ from an understrand, we will return into $K_1$ to meet an overstrand and vice versa. The same holds for $K_2$.
            \item Case A: Leaving from an understrand in $K_1$, enter $K_2$ on an understrand. The next crossing (continuing through $K_2$) will be an overstrand, and then an understrand, \dots\ Eventually, by the above, we will return from $K_2$ on an overstrand into an overstrand on $K_1$. The next crossing (continuing through $K_1$) will be an understrand, and then an overstrand, \dots\ Eventually, we will return to where we started.
            \item Case B: Leaving from an overstrand in $K_1$, enter $K_2$ on an overstrand. The next crossing (continuing through $K_2$) will be an understrand, and then an overstrand, \dots\ Eventually, by the above, we will return from $K_2$ on an understrand into an understrand on $K_1$. The next crossing (continuing through $K_1$) will be an overstrand, and then an understrand, \dots\ Eventually, we will return to where we started.
        \end{itemize}
        \item In both Cases A and B, the only moments of nonalternation are two consecutive underpasses (or overpasses) followed by a factor knot followed by two consecutive overpasses (or underpasses). Notice this pattern in Figure \ref{fig:alternatingcomposd}.
        \item Thus, "slide" one strand of a factor knot over the other knot to eliminate the nonalternation, as in Figure \ref{fig:alternatingcompose}.
        \item Q.E.D.

\section{Surfaces and Knots}
\subsection{Surfaces without Boundary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Surface}: The two-dimensional exterior of a three-dimensional object with volume.
    \item \textbf{Torus}: \dq{The surface of a donut}{71}
    \item \dq{At any point on a surface, there is a small region on the surface surrounding and containing the point that looks like a disk}{72}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The disk may be deformed (curved), but it must still be a disk.
        \item Objects that are not surfaces have points with nondisk "neighborhoods" around them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Surfaces can also be called \textbf{two-manifolds}.
    \item \textbf{Two-manifold}: \dq{Any object such that every point in that object has a neighborhood in the object that is a (possibly nonflat) disk}{73}
    \item \emph{Exercise 4.1}: Based on the definition for two-manifolds, decide what the definition should be for a one-manifold. Find two different one manifolds.

        \item Any object such that every point in that object has a neighborhood in the object that is a (possibly not straight) line.
    \end{itemize}
    \item See Section \ref{sse:topology} for info on three-manifolds.
    \item Think of surfaces as being made of rubber. In Figure \ref{fig:cubesphere}, the deformation is an \textbf{isotropy} and the left and right surfaces are \textbf{isotropic surfaces}.
    \item \textbf{Isotropy}: A continuous deformation of a surface in space; a rubber deformation.
    \item \textbf{Isotropic surfaces}: Two surfaces in space that are equivalent under an isotropy.
\end{itemize}
